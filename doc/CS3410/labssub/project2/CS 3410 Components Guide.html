  <h1>CS 3410 Components Library Guide</h1>

  <hr>

  <p>The "CS3410 Components" library will only appear if you are using the most recent version of Logisim, downloaded from the course website. Please ensure that you are using the correct version. If so, you should have a folder in your sidebar containing the following components:</p>

  <h3 id="registerfile">Register File.</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        A 32-bit wide by 32-registers deep register file. Register
        <code>x0</code> is hard-wired to zero at all times, and writes to
        <code>x0</code> are ignored. You can rely on register <code>x0</code>
        always containing 0, and do not need to test that its value does not
        change. Inputs <code>xA</code> and <code>xB</code> are used to select
        register values to output on the <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>
        outputs. When the clock is triggered, if <code>WE</code> is high, the
        data value at input <code>W</code> is stored in register
        <code>xW</code>. The register file can be configured to use rising
        clock edges as trigger (the default), falling edge, or to be level
        sensitive.

  <h3 id="rom">RISC-V Program ROM.</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        A 32-bit wide byte-addressed ROM, with built-in RISC-V assembler. Use the
        attributes panel to load a RISC-V assembly file into the ROM. The
        <code>PC</code> input specifies the address of the current instruction,
        and must be a multiple of 4. The output is the 32-bit machine code
        instruction at the PC address, or an error if the PC is invalid.
        Reading addresses outside the range of code supplied by the assembly
        file will cause the ROM to output zero, which happens to encode a no-op
        in RISC-V. The assembly language is in the format described below. When
        we say that the instruction ROM is byte-addressed memory, we mean that
        the instruction ROM takes an address A as input, advances A bytes into
        its memory (remember, 1 byte = 8 bits), and outputs the 32-bit
        instruction that starts at the resulting position. 32 bits is 4 bytes,
        which is why the PC normally increments by 4 every cycle: it's simply
        going to the next instruction.

  <h3 id="ram">RAM.</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <h4>Inputs and Outputs</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><code>A</code> is the word-address. Each line in the RAM component is a word (four bytes)
        in memory, and has a unique address. As in the example figure to the right,
        <code>A</code> = 0x00002 refers to slot 00002 in the RAM component, which contains a full
        word. However, for a given address in RAM, if you want to retrieve a specific byte
        or halfword in the address, you need to use the selector bits (described below). By
        default, the component's address width is 20 bits (which means that, by default, it
        can store 2^20 words = 4 * 2^20 bytes = 4MB).</li>

        <li><code>D</code> contains the data to be stored in RAM. Depending on how <code>sel</code> is set,
        only certain bytes within <code>D</code> will be written.</li>

        <li><code>str</code> is the store bit. You can think of it as Write Enable. When str = 1,
        RAM will write the value on <code>D</code> to address <code>A</code> according to the sel bits.</li>

        <li><code>sel</code> is for the selector bits. As mentioned above, bits 0..7 of <code>D</code>
        correspond to <code>sel</code> = 0001, bits 8..15 correspond to <code>sel</code> = 0010, bits
        16..23 to 0100, and bits 24..31 to 1000. <code>sel</code> accepts other combinations like
        1100 (to grab the upper halfword), 1111 (to grab the full word), or even something
        wacky like 1010.</li>

        <li><code>ld</code> is the load bit. Data Out <code>D</code> always sets floating values (X's) along the
        wire unless the appropriate selector bits are set and ld = 1.</li>

        <li><code>clr</code> clears all of RAM whenever it is 1.</li>
      </ul>

  <h4>Using the Byte Selector</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        As previously mentioned, address <code>A</code> gets us to the word in memory. However, we need
        to use <code>sel</code> to determine which bytes in the word we want to write to or read from.
        The Byte selector is 4 bits, and you can think of each bit as a read/write enable for each
        of the four bytes in the word.
        <br>
        Specifically, bit 0 of <code>sel</code> enables the first byte from the right in the RAM component.
        When writing to RAM, bits 0 to 7 of DataIn are written to this byte, and when reading from RAM,
        the byte's value gets read out to bits 0 to 7 of DataOut. Bit 1 of <code>sel</code> enables the
        second byte from the right, and corresponds with bits 8 to 15 of DataIn and DataOut. Bit 2 enables
        the third byte from the right and corresponds with bits 16 to 23, and bit 3 enables the fourth byte,
        and corresponds with bits 24 to 31.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h4>Storing</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        Writing into the RAM component requires that the <code>str</code> bit is set to 1.
        <br>
        In the example to the right, DataIn is set so that a hex value 0xf1 is in the bottom line (bits 7..0),
        0xf2 is in the second line (bits 15..8), 0xf3 is in the third line (bits 23..16), and 0xf4 is
        in the top line (bits 24..31). The gif demonstrates how to write different bytes or
        halfwords to the RAM.
        <br>
        When you want to write a byte to a location in RAM, pay attention that you place the
        byte-values in DataIn correctly with selector bits. In the example above, if you wanted to
        write 0xf1 to left-most byte, you would need to put 0xf1 in bits 24..31 in DataIn and
        set <code>sel</code> = 1000.
      </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h4>Loading</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        Reading from the RAM component requires that the <code>ld</code> bit is set to 1.
        <br>
        Loading is a bit more straightforward. Just be sure that when you are reading a byte from memory
        that you retrieve the byte from the right bits on DataOut. For example, if you were only selecting
        with <code>sel</code> = 0100, then you'd have to make sure that, when you're splitting DataOut, that you
        isolate the correct byte (bits 23..16).
      </p>

  <h4>A Note on Implementing Byte Addressed Memory</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        All the addresses that we deal with in the instruction set are expressed in terms of <i>byte addresses</i>.
        This means that address 0x0000 refers to the first byte in memory, and 0x0001 the second byte, and so on.
        Since every word has four bytes (in other words, since every four bytes is a new word), then 0x0000 still refers to the first word,
        but the second word is at address 0x0004.
        <br>
        It is key that you understand that the RAM is word addressed. It is an error to pass the raw byte-address into the A input.
